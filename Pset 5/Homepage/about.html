                    <p>I earned certifications in IT, and I also possess skills in Electrical Technologies. I have built Electronic projects while I still was in school, but realised my true passion in software development. I also studied Computer Science for a year at the University of Pretoria, where I learned to program in C++ at that time.</p>

					<p>I worked for a year as a IT Technician where I was the only person managing the IT for an entire business. I learned some valuable skills like fixing computers running with legacy software, being a call center agent, extra skills in Excel, and also printing cards for the company that clients can use.</p>
