About the project:
The entire purpose of the project is to create a web application that can run internally in a Local Area Network (LAN) that anyone inside a business can use. What the program accomplishes is to automate the work that a person would do on a Excel Workbook so that employees do not need to do all the repetitive Excel work themselves.
